# Breakout-Trading-Strategy
Breakout trading strategy is a trading strategy investors use to take advantage of significant price moves in the early stages of a trend.


A breakout occurs when the price of an asset moves above a resistance level or below a support level when volume increases. 
By indentifying support and resistance levels, traders can plan entry and exit points using current price trend patterns.
Breakout trading is only successful when a plan for cutting losses is implemented and discipline is exercised.
Breakouts can occur in many market environements, and are apllicable to various trading styles and timeframes.

Key summary:
Trigger events: traders often wait for a signficant price movement, triggered by an event that can lead to increased voltatility. This could be a news release, economic reports or other catalysts for example.
Confirmation Signals: Successful traders seek confirmation signals, such as higher trading volume or technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index or Moving Averages

Pros:
- Can profit from swift market movements
- Entry and exit points are clearly defined
- Strategy is applicable across various trading styles and timeframes

Cons:
- Demands swift decision making
- False breakouts are common due to false signals
- Additional signals can reduce false breakouts, but this can lead to missed moves
